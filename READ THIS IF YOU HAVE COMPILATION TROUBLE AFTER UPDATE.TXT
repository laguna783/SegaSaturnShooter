Hi!

I recently change the GCC compiler to a new version (9.3) and I also change the binary format
from COFF (Common Object File Format) which is obsolete to ELF (Executable and Linkable Format).

In order to compile, you have to pick the new scripts in any samples like "demo1" and copy them on your project:

	clean.bat
	clean.sh
	compile.bat
	run_with_daemon_tools_and_ssf.bat
	run_with_mednafen.bat
	run_with_nova.bat
	run_with_powershell_and_ssf.ps1
	run_with_virtual_clone_drive_and_ssf.bat
	run_with_yabaSanshiro.bat
	run_with_yabause.bat
	run_with_yabause.sh

Output files are also changed:

	sl_coff.coff => game.elf
	sl_coff.iso => game.iso
	sl_coff.cue => game.cue
	sl_coff.map => game.map
	sl_coff.bin => game.bin
